 "content": "# Using Raw HTML in React\n\nIn React, if you wanted to directly use HTML text as a content, you need to use the attribute called \"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\". It can be used like this:\n\n```\n<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: sanitized_string }}\n```\n\nNotice that this attribute needs to be passed an object with a key **__html** . Useful if you are using a library like 'marked' that would be compile markdown to the html on the fly. Be careful with this attribute though, the name doesn't sound threatening for no reason.",
