Pretty neat to have a very accessible function that allows for creating unique values from a given string but apperantly this function is not suitable to be used on Unicode strings. You can use the atob() function to decode the base-64 encoded string.\n\nMore information is at this [mdn page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/Base64_encoding_and_decoding)",

  "content": "# Using Raw HTML in React\n\nIn React, if you wanted to directly use HTML text as a content, you need to use the attribute called \"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\". It can be used like this:\n\n```\n<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: sanitized_string }}\n```\n\nNotice that this attribute needs to be passed an object with a key **__html** . Useful if you are using a library like 'marked' that would be compile markdown to the html on the fly. Be careful with this attribute though, the name doesn't sound threatening for no reason.",
